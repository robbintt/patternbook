# if you are installing locally, this will install the dotfiles to your local directory
# remotely this works fine... this is probably WONTFIX because it's a pretty special case

# this recursively deploys the `private` repository as well
# NB: This deploy key must be on both dotfiles and any recursive subrepositories because 
# it is used for auth to dotfiles as well.
